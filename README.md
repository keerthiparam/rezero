## üîí Overview

This system provides enterprise-grade data sanitization for various storage devices including HDDs, SSDs, NVMe drives, and Android devices. Each sanitization process generates a cryptographically signed certificate that serves as tamper-proof evidence of secure data destruction.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Multi-Device Support**: HDDs, SATA/PCIe SSDs, NVMe drives, and Android devices
- **Cryptographic Certificates**: RSA-signed JSON certificates with verification data
- **Human-Readable Reports**: PDF certificates with QR codes for verification
- **Offline Operation**: Bootable ISO for air-gapped environments
- **CLI & GUI**: Command-line tools and desktop interface
- **Verification System**: Web-based certificate validation

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Linux development machine (Ubuntu/Debian recommended)
- Root access for device operations
- Test devices for safe development

### Installation

\`\`\`bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/wipe-certificate-generation.git
cd wipe-certificate-generation

# Install required tools
sudo apt update
sudo apt install hdparm nvme-cli blkdiscard shred lsblk jq openssl wkhtmltopdf qrencode

# Make CLI tool executable
chmod +x wipectl.sh
\`\`\`

### Basic Usage

\`\`\`bash
# Dry run (safe testing)
./wipectl.sh --dry /dev/sdX

# Live wipe (DESTRUCTIVE - use with caution)
./wipectl.sh --live /dev/sdX

# Generate certificate
python3 gen_cert.py /dev/sdX

# Sign certificate
openssl dgst -sha256 -sign signer.key -out cert.sig cert.json

# Verify certificate
openssl dgst -sha256 -verify signer.pub.pem -signature cert.sig cert.json
\`\`\`

## üìã Supported Devices

### Storage Devices
- **HDDs**: ATA Secure Erase via hdparm
- **SATA SSDs**: ATA Secure Erase with cryptographic verification
- **NVMe SSDs**: Format with Secure Erase Settings (SES)
- **PCIe SSDs**: Vendor-specific secure erase commands

### Mobile Devices
- **Android (Non-rooted)**: Factory reset with encryption verification
- **Android (Service mode)**: ADB/Fastboot userdata wiping
- **iOS**: Guided secure erase process

## üîê Security Features

- **RSA Digital Signatures**: 3072-bit keys for certificate authenticity
- **Cryptographic Verification**: SHA-256 hashing of wiped sectors
- **Tamper Evidence**: Signed certificates prevent modification
- **Audit Trail**: Complete sanitization history and verification data

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Workflow

1. **Setup**: Initialize test environment with disposable devices
2. **Development**: Create sanitization methods for each device type
3. **Testing**: Validate wipe effectiveness with forensic tools
4. **Certification**: Generate and sign completion certificates
5. **Verification**: Implement certificate validation system

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Safety Warnings

- **DESTRUCTIVE OPERATIONS**: All wipe operations permanently destroy data
- **TEST ENVIRONMENT ONLY**: Never run on production systems
- **EXPLICIT CONSENT**: Always require owner confirmation before wiping
- **BACKUP VERIFICATION**: Ensure no important data exists before proceeding

## üß™ Testing & Validation

### Pre-Wipe Testing
\`\`\`bash
# Record sample data before wipe
dd if=/dev/sdX bs=4096 count=1 skip=0 of=before0.bin
sha256sum before0.bin
\`\`\`

### Post-Wipe Verification
\`\`\`bash
# Verify wipe effectiveness
dd if=/dev/sdX bs=4096 count=1 skip=0 of=after0.bin
sha256sum after0.bin

# Attempt data recovery (should fail)
photorec /dev/sdX
